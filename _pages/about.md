Hi! I'm Reagan, an Assistant Professor in the <a style='color: black;' href='https://www.bentley.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences'>Department of Mathematical Sciences</a> at Bentley University. I'm a statistician and methodologist whose research focuses on the development and application of methods for causal inference with complex data, including text data, randomized experiments complicated by issues such as non-compliance, and observational studies with time-varying treatments. 

Research
------
My research focuses on methodological problems related to causal inference in complex experiments and observational studies, particularly in settings where the covariates and/or outcomes of interest are defined by features or summary measures of text

Teaching
------
Pedagogy is an integral part of my career as a researcher and statistician. As an educator, I strive to foster enthusiasm for statistics by developing curriculum and external initiatives that empower students to actively engage with data in and out of the classroom.
